# BantuPay Documentation

This documentation describes the UI and UX component system that powers the
presentation layer of the BantuPay Superâ€‘App.

## Target Audience

- Developers
- Designers
- Product Managers

## Design System Overview

The design system must adhere to an **8pt grid**, leverage the brand's design
tokens and provide light/dark theme switching. Components should be implemented
with Ant Design Mobile and documented in Storybook.

## Subtasks

- [ ] Define atomic design layers (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms)
- [ ] Implement typography and color components using brand tokens
- [ ] Build button, badge, icon and chip components
- [ ] Build input, form and validation components
- [ ] Create layout primitives (Grid, Flex, Spacing)
- [ ] Build composite components (Cards, Menus, Modals, Bottom Sheets)
- [ ] Integrate theme switching logic
- [ ] Setup Storybook with live previews
- [ ] Add unit & visual regression tests
- [ ] Auto-generate component documentation

## Deliverables

- `src/components/` folder containing atoms, molecules and organisms
- `tokens/` folder with synced design tokens
- `storybook/` folder with preview stories
- Dark and light theme toggles
- Test coverage and snapshot diffs
